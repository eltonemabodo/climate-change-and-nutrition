## Introduction

This is a public repository of the code that has been used to analyse four waves of the Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey (ZDHS) data from 1999/2000 to 2015 
(being the latest survey as of the date of the study). The study aims to investigate the relationship between climate chnage (using precipitation and rainfall anomally 
as the climate indicators of choice) and the nutrition outcomes of children under the age of five in Zimbabwe.

## Methods

The study utilised a pseudo-panel estimation techniques, following the work of Angus (1985). In this study, the cohorts were created using the province in which the 
child was born (to allow merging the climate data that was available only at provincial level) and the gender of the child. All estimations were done using the 
fixed effects panel regression technique.
